# Welcome to the H2DesignLab at HCI@Stevens!

We believe multidisciplinarity and creativity are the keys to strong HCI, social computing, and health informatics research. Therefore, we are a group of people with various backgrounds—art and design, information and computer sciences, psychology, and statistics (and more coming)—and we collaborate with a wide array of people with interests and expertise in medicine, nursing, clinical psychology, and public health with the same aim: How can we use advancing technology to support health?

We develop and evaluate design solutions for multiple health spaces, spanning from youth and young adult mental health to parenting of young children, social isolation of older adults, and informal caregivers of chronically ill individuals. We study how emerging technology (e.g., large language models) can contribute to those solutions.
